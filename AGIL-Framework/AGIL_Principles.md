## Definition

**AGIL (AI-Guided Inquiry Learning)** is an educational framework and instructional approach that integrates inquiry-based learning with structured, transparent use of artificial intelligence to support student exploration, verification, and reflection across scientific and technical disciplines.

---

## Core Principles

AGIL is grounded in the following principles, which define its appropriate use across disciplines.

### 1. Inquiry First

Learning begins with authentic, open-ended questions rather than predefined solutions. Problems are selected to encourage exploration, hypothesis formation, and sense-making.

### 2. AI as a Guided Learning Partner

Artificial intelligence is used deliberately as a **supportive cognitive tool**, not as an answer generator. Students are expected to interrogate, refine, and verify AI outputs.

### 3. Verification and Transparency

Students explicitly document:
- How AI tools were used
- What sources were consulted
- How claims were verified or challenged

AI use is visible, assessable, and subject to academic scrutiny.

### 4. Artifact-Based Evidence of Learning

Assessment emphasizes **learning artifacts**—analyses, models, code, explanations, and reflections—rather than time spent or rote reproduction.

### 5. Milestone-Based Progression

Progress is measured by demonstrated competencies and learning milestones, not seat time alone.

### 6. Instructor and Discipline Autonomy

AGIL defines a learning **architecture**, not content. Instructors retain full authority over disciplinary standards, learning objectives, and assessment criteria.

### 7. Academic Integrity and Openness

AGIL aligns with established principles of academic integrity and supports open critique, adaptation, and scholarly discussion of its methods.
