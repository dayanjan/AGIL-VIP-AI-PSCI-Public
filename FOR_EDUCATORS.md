# For Educators

## Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in AGIL. If you're considering using these materials in your teaching, I'd love to hear from you.

## What's in This Repository

Everything here is freely available under CC BY-NC 4.0:

- **20 empty talktorials** - Guided inquiry notebooks where students write code with AI assistance
- **AGIL framework documentation** - The theoretical foundations and principles
- **Curriculum overview** - Structure and progression of the 20-week curriculum

## Solution Notebooks

To preserve academic integrity, solution notebooks (with complete working code) are not included in this public repository. If you're an instructor planning to use AGIL in your course, I'm happy to share solutions directly.

**To request access:**

Send me an email from your institutional address:

- **To**: wijesingheds@vcu.edu
- **Subject**: AGIL Solutions Request
- **Include**: Your name, institution, and the course where you plan to use AGIL

That's it - no formal application process. I just want to keep solutions out of student hands.

## Adapting AGIL for Your Context

Please feel free to:

- Modify talktorials for your institution's computing environment
- Adjust the 6-target portfolio to match your curriculum focus
- Create new guided inquiries following the AGIL format
- Translate materials (with attribution)

If you create interesting adaptations, I'd genuinely love to hear about them.

## Questions?

- **General questions**: Open an issue on this repository
- **Solutions access**: wijesingheds@vcu.edu
- **Collaboration ideas**: Always welcome!

## Citation

If AGIL is useful in your teaching or research, a citation to the framework paper would be appreciated. See [README.md](README.md) for citation information.
