    "\n",
    "### Why Molecular Representations Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational drug discovery, we need ways to represent molecules that computers can understand. Just as DNA sequences encode genetic information as strings of letters (A, T, G, C), we have developed notations to encode chemical structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge: a molecule is a 3D object with atoms and bonds, but computers work best with text strings and numbers. Different representations serve different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Representation | Purpose | Example |\n",
    "|----------------|---------|--------|\n",
    "| **SMILES** | Human-readable, searchable | `CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O` |\n",
    "| **InChI** | Unique identifier | `InChI=1S/C9H8O4/c1-6(10)...` |\n",
    "| **InChIKey** | Database lookup | `BSYNRYMUTXBXSQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N` |\n",
    "| **PDB** | 3D coordinates | Atom positions in space |\n",
    "| **MOL/SDF** | Complete structure | 2D/3D with all properties |\n",
    "\n",
    "### SMILES: Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System\n",
    "\n",
    "SMILES was developed in the 1980s as a way to represent molecules as text strings. Key rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Atoms**: Written as element symbols (C, N, O, S, etc.)\n",
    "- **Bonds**: Single bonds are implicit; `=` for double, `#` for triple\n",
    "- **Branches**: Shown in parentheses `()`\n",
    "- **Rings**: Indicated by numbers at ring closure points\n",
    "- **Aromaticity**: Lowercase letters (c, n, o) indicate aromatic atoms\n",
    "\n",
    "### InChI: International Chemical Identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "InChI is a unique, canonical identifier developed by IUPAC. Unlike SMILES (where the same molecule can have multiple valid representations), every molecule has exactly one standard InChI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **InChIKey** is a 27-character hash of the InChI, designed for database searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PDB Format: Protein Data Bank\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDB format stores 3D atomic coordinates, originally designed for proteins but also used for small molecules. Each `ATOM` or `HETATM` line contains:\n",
    "- Atom name, residue, coordinates (x, y, z)\n",
    "- Useful for docking, visualization, and structural analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Canonical SMILES**: A unique, standardized SMILES for a molecule\n",
    "- **Isomeric SMILES**: Includes stereochemistry information\n",
    "- **2D vs 3D**: 2D shows connectivity; 3D shows actual spatial arrangement\n",
    "- **Molecular fingerprints**: Bit vectors encoding structural features (we'll cover these later)\n",
