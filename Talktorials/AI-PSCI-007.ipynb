        "\n",
        "Fingerprints are foundational to:\n",
        "- **Virtual screening**: Finding compounds similar to known actives\n",
        "- **Clustering**: Grouping molecules by structural similarity\n",
        "- **Machine learning**: Input features for activity prediction models\n",
        "- **Database searching**: Efficient similarity searches across millions of compounds\n",
