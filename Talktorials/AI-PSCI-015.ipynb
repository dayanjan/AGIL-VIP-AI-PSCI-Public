    "\n",
    "### What is Molecular Docking?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Molecular docking** is a computational technique that predicts how a small molecule (ligand) binds to a protein target. It answers two key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Where** does the ligand bind? (binding pose/geometry)\n",
    "2. **How strongly** does it bind? (binding affinity/score)\n",
    "\n",
    "Docking is central to drug discovery because it allows researchers to:\n",
    "- Screen millions of compounds *in silico* before synthesis\n",
    "- Understand drug-target interactions at atomic detail\n",
    "- Design improved drugs by optimizing binding interactions\n",
    "- Predict effects of protein mutations on drug binding\n",
    "\n",
    "### How AutoDock Vina Works\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoDock Vina uses a combination of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sampling algorithm**: Iterated local search + gradient optimization to explore ligand conformations\n",
    "2. **Scoring function**: Empirical function combining:\n",
    "   - Steric interactions (shape complementarity)\n",
    "   - Hydrophobic effects\n",
    "   - Hydrogen bonding\n",
    "   - Torsional penalties\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a **docking score** in kcal/mol (more negative = stronger predicted binding).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations to Keep in Mind\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Protein flexibility**: Vina treats the protein as rigid (though you can make specific residues flexible)\n",
    "- **Scoring accuracy**: Scores correlate with affinity but are not exact binding energies\n",
    "- **Binding site required**: You must define where to dock (unlike AI methods like DiffDock)\n",
    "- **Water and ions**: Often ignored, though they can be critical for binding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PDBQT format**: Special file format that includes partial charges and atom types\n",
    "- **Binding box**: The 3D region where docking is performed\n",
    "- **Exhaustiveness**: Number of independent docking runs (higher = more thorough but slower)\n",
    "- **RMSD**: Root Mean Square Deviation - measures how similar two poses are\n",
