        "\n",
        "- **API failures**: External services (ChEMBL, PDB, ESMFold) may be down or rate-limited\n",
        "- **Data quality issues**: Missing values, incorrect formats, unexpected molecules\n",
        "- **Memory constraints**: Large datasets or batch processing may exhaust resources\n",
        "- **Numerical errors**: NaN values, division by zero, floating point precision\n",

        "3. **Understand**: What does the error message actually tell you?\n",
        "4. **Fix**: Apply the smallest change that resolves the issue\n",
        "5. **Verify**: Confirm the fix works and doesn't break other things\n",
        "6. **Document**: Record what went wrong and how you fixed it\n",

        "### Key Concepts\n",
        "- **Traceback**: The sequence of function calls leading to an error\n",
