    "\n",
    "### The Evolution of Molecular Docking\n",
    "\n",
    "In AI-PSCI-015, we used **AutoDock Vina** \u2014 a physics-based docking method that uses empirical scoring functions. While effective, these methods have limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Require a predefined binding site** (you must know where to dock)\n",
    "- **Rigid protein assumption** (protein doesn't move during docking)\n",
    "- **Scoring function limitations** (empirical formulas miss some interactions)\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-powered docking methods aim to overcome these limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### DiffDock: Diffusion Models for Docking\n",
    "\n",
    "**DiffDock** (Corso et al., 2023) treats molecular docking as a generative modeling problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses **diffusion models** (like DALL-E for images, but for molecules)\n",
    "- Performs **blind docking** \u2014 finds the binding site automatically\n",
    "- Learns from thousands of experimental protein-ligand structures\n",
    "- Returns **confidence scores** for each predicted pose\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Start with ligand in random position/orientation\n",
    "2. Iteratively \"denoise\" to find the true binding pose\n",
    "3. The diffusion process explores multiple binding sites simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "### GNINA: CNN-Enhanced Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "**GNINA** (McNutt et al., 2021) enhances traditional docking with neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built on AutoDock Vina's sampling algorithm\n",
    "- Uses **3D convolutional neural networks** (CNNs) for scoring\n",
    "- Trained on experimental binding affinity data\n",
    "- Provides two scores: **CNN_score** (pose quality) and **CNN_affinity** (binding strength)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key advantage:** Learns complex patterns from data that physics-based functions miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each Method\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Best For | Limitations |\n",
    "|--------|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **AutoDock Vina** | Fast screening, known binding sites | Rigid protein, requires binding box |\n",
    "| **DiffDock** | Blind docking, novel targets, cryptic sites | Slower, requires GPU |\n",
    "| **GNINA** | Rescoring poses, improved ranking | Still requires binding box |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blind docking**: Finding the binding site without prior knowledge\n",
    "- **Diffusion models**: Generative AI that learns to reverse a noising process\n",
    "- **CNN scoring**: Using convolutional neural networks to evaluate poses\n",
    "- **Confidence score**: Model's estimate of prediction quality (higher = more confident)\n",
