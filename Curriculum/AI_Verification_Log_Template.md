# AI Verification Log Template

## AI-PSCI: AI in Pharmaceutical Sciences — Bench to Bedside

---

## Purpose

This log ensures that you are critically evaluating AI-generated information rather than accepting it at face value. **Verification means checking a primary source**—not asking the AI "Are you sure?" or rephrasing your question.

Use this template for every significant factual claim from AI that you rely upon in your work. Include this log as part of your Weekly Inquiry Logs in your Digital Lab Notebook.

## What Counts as a Primary Source?

| ✅ Acceptable Primary Sources | ❌ Not Primary Sources |
|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Peer-reviewed journal articles (PubMed, Google Scholar) | Wikipedia |
| FDA/EMA regulatory documents | AI follow-up responses |
| Official pharmaceutical company documentation | News articles (without citations) |
| Clinical trial databases (ClinicalTrials.gov) | Blog posts |
| UniProt, PDB, ChEMBL, DrugBank databases | Social media |
| Textbooks with citations | Other AI tools |
| Government health agency publications (CDC, WHO, NIH) | YouTube videos (unless citing sources) |

## AI Verification Log Format

Copy the table below into your lab notebook for each week's guided inquiry questions. Add rows as needed.

### Week: _____ | Date: _____ | Guided Inquiry Question #: _____

| # | AI Tool Used | AI-Generated Claim | Verification Source (Full Citation/URL) | Verification Status | Notes/Discrepancies |
|---|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | |

### Verification Status Options:
- **✅ Confirmed** — Primary source fully supports the AI claim
- **⚠️ Partially Confirmed** — Primary source supports the claim but with important nuances or caveats
- **❌ Contradicted** — Primary source contradicts the AI claim (document what the source actually says)
- **❓ Unable to Verify** — Could not find a primary source to confirm or deny (note what you searched)

## Example Entry

### Week: 3 | Date: Jan 27, 2026 | Guided Inquiry Question #2: "What is the difference between structure-based and ligand-based drug design in AI?"

| # | AI Tool Used | AI-Generated Claim | Verification Source (Full Citation/URL) | Verification Status | Notes/Discrepancies |
|---|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Claude | "Structure-based drug design requires knowledge of the 3D structure of the target protein, typically obtained through X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM." | Sliwoski G, et al. (2014). Computational methods in drug discovery. *Pharmacol Rev.* 66(1):334-95. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24381236/ | ✅ Confirmed | Source also mentions NMR as a third method for obtaining structures, which AI omitted. |
| 2 | Claude | "Ligand-based approaches are used when the target structure is unknown and rely on known active compounds to predict new ones." | Same as above | ✅ Confirmed | — |
| 3 | ChatGPT | "AlphaFold has made structure-based drug design possible for over 98% of human proteins." | Jumper J, et al. (2021). Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold. *Nature.* 596:583-589. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2 | ⚠️ Partially Confirmed | AlphaFold covers most human proteins but prediction confidence varies; not all structures are drug-discovery ready. The 98% figure refers to coverage, not accuracy. |
| 4 | ChatGPT | "QSAR models were first developed in the 1990s." | Hansch C, Fujita T. (1964). p-σ-π Analysis. A Method for the Correlation of Biological Activity and Chemical Structure. *J Am Chem Soc.* 86(8):1616-1626. | ❌ Contradicted | QSAR dates to 1964 (Hansch-Fujita), not the 1990s. AI was incorrect by ~30 years. |

## Reflection Prompts

After completing your verification log each week, briefly reflect on:

1. **What percentage of AI claims were you able to verify?** (Aim for verifying at least 3-5 significant claims per guided inquiry question.)

2. **Did you find any contradictions?** What does this tell you about using AI for pharmaceutical research?

3. **What verification strategies worked best?** (e.g., specific databases, search terms, types of sources)

4. **How did the verification process deepen your understanding** of the topic beyond what the AI provided?

## Grading Criteria for AI Verification Logs

Your verification logs will be evaluated as part of your Digital Lab Notebook (15% of course grade). Specifically:

| Criterion | Excellent | Satisfactory | Needs Improvement |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Source Quality** | Uses peer-reviewed journals, official databases, and authoritative sources | Mix of primary and secondary sources | Relies on non-authoritative sources or AI self-verification |
| **Verification Thoroughness** | 3-5+ claims verified per inquiry question with full citations | 1-2 claims verified per inquiry question | Minimal or no verification attempted |
| **Critical Analysis** | Identifies nuances, caveats, and contradictions; notes AI limitations | Notes basic confirmation/contradiction | Simply states "verified" without analysis |
| **Citation Format** | Complete citations with working URLs/DOIs | Partial citations | Missing or incomplete citations |

## Quick Reference: Where to Verify Common Pharmaceutical AI Claims

| Topic Area | Recommended Primary Sources |
|------------|----------------------------|
| Drug mechanisms & pharmacology | PubMed, DrugBank, FDA drug labels |
| Protein structures | Protein Data Bank (PDB), UniProt, AlphaFold DB |
| Clinical trial data | ClinicalTrials.gov, published trial results |
| Drug interactions | DrugBank, FDA, Lexicomp |
| Regulatory requirements | FDA.gov, EMA.europa.eu, ICH guidelines |
| Molecular properties | ChEMBL, PubChem |
| Disease information | OMIM, NIH, WHO |
| AI/ML methods | Original methodology papers, benchmark studies |

## Remember

> **"Trust, but verify."**
> 
> AI tools are powerful research accelerators, but they can confidently state incorrect information. Your verification log is both a learning tool and a professional habit that will serve you throughout your career in pharmaceutical sciences.
