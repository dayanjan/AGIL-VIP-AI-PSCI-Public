# AGIL Curriculum Overview

## AI-PSCI: AI in Pharmaceutical Sciences Talktorial Series

This curriculum consists of 20 guided inquiry notebooks (talktorials) designed for the AGIL (AI-Guided Inquiry Learning) pedagogical framework.

---

## What Are Talktorials?

Talktorials are **guided inquiry notebooks** where students:
1. Read scientific context and learning objectives
2. Write code with AI assistance (empty code cells)
3. Verify their results against expected outputs
4. Document their process in lab notebook entries

Unlike traditional tutorials with pre-written code, AGIL talktorials require students to actively construct knowledge with AI as a learning partner.

## 6-Target Drug Discovery Portfolio

Students work with one of six therapeutically diverse drug targets:

| Target | Therapeutic Area | Application |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **DHFR** | Antibiotics | Trimethoprim resistance |
| **ABL1** | Cancer (CML) | Imatinib (Gleevec) |
| **EGFR** | Cancer (NSCLC) | Erlotinib (Tarceva) |
| **AChE** | Neurodegeneration | Donepezil (Alzheimer's) |
| **COX-2** | Inflammation | Celecoxib |
| **DPP-4** | Diabetes | Sitagliptin |
